## Introduction

During my internship at Codsoft, I worked on several data science projects that involved real-world data, statistical analysis, and machine learning algorithms. This repository is a collection of those projects, showcasing my approach to solving data-driven problems and my proficiency in various data science tools and techniques.

## TITANIC SURVIVAL PREDICTION

- **Description**: This project involves building a machine learning model to predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic. The goal is to analyze the dataset provided by the Titanic competition on Kaggle and develop a predictive model that can estimate whether a passenger survived based on various features such as age, sex, passenger class, and fare.

- **Key Features**:
  - **Data Exploration:** Thorough analysis and visualization of the dataset to understand the relationships between different features and survival rates.
  - **Feature Engineering:** Creation and selection of relevant features to improve model performance.
  - **Model Building:** Implementation of various machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting, to predict survival.
  - **Evaluation:** Use of performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate the model's effectiveness.

- **Results**: 
  - The model demonstrated significant predictive power, with accuracy scores of over X% on the validation set.
  - Insights gained from the analysis highlighted key factors influencing survival rates, such as passenger class and gender.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Languages**: Python
- **Libraries/Frameworks**: NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Tools**: Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab, Git
